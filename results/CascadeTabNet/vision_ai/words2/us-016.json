Patients are instructed to indicate the place on the line corresponding to their perceived state. The mark's position is measured as the score. A VAS that has the addition of one or more intermediate marks positioned along the line with reference terms assigned to each mark to help patients identify the locations between the scale's ends (e.g., half-way). Anchored or categorized VAS Likert scale An ordered set of discrete terms or statements from which patients are asked to choose the response that best describes their state or experience. A set of numerical categories from which patients are asked to choose the category that best describes their state or experience. The ends of rating scales are anchored with words but the categories are numbered rather than labeled with words.
