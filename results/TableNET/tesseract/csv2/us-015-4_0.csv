Validity Content validity Evidence that the instrument measures the Derivation of all items
concept of interest including evidence from
qualitative studies that the items and domains
of an instrument are appropriate and
comprehensive relative to its intended
"measurement concept, population, and use."
Testing other measurement properties will

Qualitative interview schedule
Interview or focus group transcripts
Items derived from the transcripts
Composition of patients used to develop content
Cognitive interview transcripts to evaluate patient
understanding
Construct validity
"Evidence that relationships among items,"
"domains, and concepts conform to a priori"
hypotheses concerning logical relationships
that should exist with measures of related
concepts or scores produced in similar or
diverse patient groups
Strength of correlation testing a priori hypotheses
(discriminant and convergent validity)
Degree to which the PRO instrument can distinguish
among groups hypothesized a priori to be different
(known groups validity)
Ability to detect
change
Evidence that a PRO instrument can identify
differences in scores over time in individuals
or groups (similar to those in the clinical
trials) who have changed with respect to the
measurement concept
Within person change over time
