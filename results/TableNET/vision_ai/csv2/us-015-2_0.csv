VuJ 101 Uilanging Items during PRO Instrument Development
Item Property
Reason for Change or Deletion
Clarity or relevance
Reported as not relevant by a large segment of the target population
Generates an unacceptably large amount of missing data points
Generates many questions or requests for clarification from patients as they complete the PRO instrument
Patients interpret items and responses in a way that is inconsistent with the PRO instrument's conceptual framework
Response range
A high percent of patients respond at the floor (response scale's worst end) or ceiling (response scale's optimal end)
Patients note that none of the response choices applies to them
Distribution of item responses is highly skewed
Variability
"All patients give the same answer (i.e., no variance)"
Most patients choose only one response choice
Differences among patients are not detected when important differences are known
Reproducibility
Unstable scores over time when there is no logical reason for variation from
one assessment to the next
Inter-item correlation
Item highly correlated (redundant) with other items in the same concept of
interest
Ability to detect change
"Item is not sensitive (i.e., does not change when there is a known change in the concepts of interest)"
Item discrimination
Item is highly correlated with measures of concepts other than the one it is intended to measure
"Item does not show variability in relation to some known population characteristics (i.e., severity level, classification of condition, or other known characteristic)"
Redundancy
Item duplicates information collected with other items that have equal or better measurement properties
Recall period
"The population, disease state, or application of the instrument can affect the appropriateness of the recall period"
