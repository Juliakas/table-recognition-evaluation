Derivation of all items
"concept of interest including evidence from qualitative studies that the items and domains of an instrument are appropriate and comprehensive relative to its intended measurement concept, population, and use. Testing other measurement properties will not replace or rectify problems with content validity. Evidence that relationships among items, domains, and concepts conform to a priori hypotheses concerning logical relationships"
