Item Property,duri
Clarity or relevance,PRO
Response range,Reason for Change or Deletion
Variability,Reported as not relevant by a large segment of the target population
Reproducibility,Generates an unacceptably large amount of missing data points
Inter-item correlation,Generates many questions or requests for clarification from patients as they complete the PRO instrument
Ability to detect change,Patients interpret items and responses in a way that is inconsistent with the PRO instrument's conceptual framework
Item discrimination,A high percent of patients respond at the floor (response scale's worst end) or ceiling (response scale's optimal end)
Redundancy,Patients note that none of the response choices applies to them
Recall period,Distribution of item responses is highly skewed
,"All patients give the same answer (i.e., no variance)"
,Most patients choose only one response choice
,Differences among patients are not detected when important differences are known
,Unstable scores over time when there is no logical reason for variation from
,one assessment to the next
,Item highly correlated (redundant) with other items in the same concept of
,interest
,"Item is not sensitive (i.e., does not change when there is a known change in the concepts of interest)"
,Item is highly correlated with measures of concepts other than the one it is intended to measure
,"Item does not show variability in relation to some known population characteristics (i.e., severity level, classification of condition, or other known characteristic)"
,Item duplicates information collected with other items that have equal or better measurement properties
,"The population, disease state, or application of the instrument can affect the appropriateness of the recall period"
