{"text": "Measurement Property Type What Is Assessed? FDA Review Considerations Reliability Test-retest or intra\u00ac interviewer reliability (for interviewer-administered PROs only) Stability of scores over time when no change is expected in the concept of interest \u2022 Intraclass correlation coefficient \u2022 Time period of assessment Internal consistency \u2022 Extent to which items comprising a scale measure the same concept \u2022 Intercorrelation of items that contribute to a score \u2022 Internal consistency \u2022 Cronbach\u2019s alpha for summary scores \u2022 Item-total correlations Inter-interviewer reliability (for interviewer-administered PROs only) Agreement among responses when the PRO is administered by two or more different interviewers \u2022 Interclass correlation coefficient Validity Content validity Evidence that the instrument measures the concept of interest including evidence from qualitative studies that the items and domains of an instrument are appropriate and comprehensive relative to its intended measurement concept, population, and use. Testing other measurement properties will not replace or rectify problems with content validity. \u2022 Derivation of all items \u2022 Qualitative interview schedule \u2022 Interview or focus group transcripts \u2022 Items derived from the transcripts \u2022 Composition of patients used to develop content \u2022 Cognitive interview transcripts to evaluate patient understanding Construct validity Evidence that relationships among items, domains, and concepts conform to a priori hypotheses concerning logical relationships that should exist with measures of related concepts or scores produced in similar or diverse patient groups \u2022 Strength of correlation testing a priori hypotheses (discriminant and convergent validity) \u2022 Degree to which the PRO instrument can distinguish among groups hypothesized a priori to be different (known groups validity) Ability to detect change Evidence that a PRO instrument can identify differences in scores over time in individuals or groups (similar to those in the clinical trials) who have changed with respect to the measurement concept \u2022 Within person change over time \u2022 Effect size statistic Item Property Reason for Change or Deletion Clarity or relevance \u2022 Reported as not relevant by a large segment of the target population \u2022 Generates an unacceptably large amount of missing data points \u2022 Generates many questions or requests for clarification from patients as they complete the PRO instrument \u2022 Patients interpret items and responses in a way that is inconsistent with the PRO instrument\u2019s conceptual framework Response range \u2022 A high percent of patients respond at the floor (response scale\u2019s worst end) or ceiling (response scale\u2019s optimal end) \u2022 Patients note that none of the response choices applies to them \u2022 Distribution of item responses is highly skewed Variability \u2022 All patients give the same answer (i.e., no variance) \u2022 Most patients choose only one response choice \u2022 Differences among patients are not detected when important differences are known Reproducibility \u2022 Unstable scores over time when there is no logical reason for variation from one assessment to the next Inter-item correlation \u2022 Item highly correlated (redundant) with other items in the same concept of interest Ability to detect change \u2022 Item is not sensitive (i.e., does not change when there is a known change in the concepts of interest) Item discrimination \u2022 Item is highly correlated with measures of concepts other than the one it is intended to measure \u2022 Item does not show variability in relation to some known population characteristics (i.e.. severity level, classification of condition, or other known characteristic) Redundancy \u2022 Item duplicates information collected with other items that have equal or better measurement properties Recall period \u2022 The population, disease state, or application of the instrument can affect the appropriateness of the recall period", "cellCount": 45}
